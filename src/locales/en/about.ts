        description: `<p>My curiosity about technology and the web sparked in my childhood, back when I got my hands on my first <span class='font-bold text-yellow-300'>Game Boy</span>, and it&apos;s been burning ever since, fueled by the desire to uncover the <span className='italic text-amber-500'>magic</span> behind them. During the boom of online forums I took my first steps into the world of programming, breaking and fixing elements that I barely understood. I was fascinated by what this realm had to offer, so I decided to dive deeper into a path that would let me be a part of it.</p>
        <p>When I hit twenty, I realized that this passion could be so much more: I decided to consolidate what I had learned until then, to venture into the working world and take on <span class='font-bold text-blue-500'>web development</span> in a professional way, no longer as a self-taught tinkerer. I believe that collaborating with people is a crucial forge for crafting innovative approaches and self-improvement, both in my skills and in myself. <i>I&apos;m always up for any new adventure that comes my way.</i></p>
        <p>I love getting lost on trails and going on <span class='text-slate-500'>long walks</span>, especially when surrounded by nature, and I always keep a backpack for them. In my free time, I enjoy playing board games and role-playing games... <span className={'italic line-through'}>but mostly, I accumulate side projects</span>.</p>`,
